SDL Platformer
==============

Small platformer I've started working on in my freetime, pardon the 
contrast in graphical styles, I've just been grabbing art assets of the
internet, I'm a programmer lol.

Usage
-----
In main.cpp change the absolute path I had to use because of XCode to
whatever the path is for you, probably "Images/xxxx.png", Then compile it
and enjoy
